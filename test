Hello ,

Thank you so much for your offer. Im so excited about joining the "Impex" Company team. 

Before officially accepting, I'd love to discuss with you for adjusting the salary and have a few clarification questions on some of the benefits information. 

After considerable thought, I am concerned about the salary(Only 3% hike) you offered. It is lower than I anticipated. 
As I am already getting the same salary in my current job, I am expecting a hike about 25% in my new job.

So Here I would like to request you to reconsider my salary offered.

Thanks
